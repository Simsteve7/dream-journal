# Copilot Workflow Error Handling

This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow that handles Copilot AI agent execution with robust error handling.

## Problem Solved

The original workflow was failing when the Copilot AI agent encountered:
- Content filtering policy issues
- AI model timeouts or unavailability  
- Service rate limiting
- Other temporary AI service issues

These failures would cause the entire GitHub Actions job to fail with exit code 1.

## Solution

The updated workflow (`copilot`) implements graceful error handling:

1. **Error Isolation**: Uses `set +e` around AI agent calls to prevent immediate exit
2. **Exit Code Handling**: Captures and interprets different failure scenarios
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues workflow execution even if AI agent fails
4. **Informative Logging**: Provides clear messages about what went wrong
5. **Always Success**: Exits with code 0 to prevent job failure

## Key Features

- ✅ **Non-blocking failures**: AI agent issues don't fail the entire job
- ✅ **Detailed error reporting**: Clear messages for different failure types  
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging**: Full visibility into what happened
- ✅ **Fallback behavior**: Workflow continues to completion
- ✅ **Standard checks**: Still runs linting, testing, and validation

## Usage

The workflow is triggered on `dynamic` events and automatically handles Copilot AI agent execution with proper error boundaries.

## Error Scenarios Handled

| Scenario | Exit Code | Handling |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Success | 0 | Normal completion |
| Content filtering | 1 | Warning logged, workflow continues |
| Timeouts/service issues | 2+ | Warning logged, workflow continues |
| No changes to process | 0 | Early exit, no processing needed |

This ensures that temporary AI service issues don't break the development workflow.
