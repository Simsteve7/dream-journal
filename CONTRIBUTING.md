## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
- **Code Contributions**: Submit bug fixes or new features
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation and examples
- **Translation**: Help translate the app to new languages
- **Testing**: Write tests or improve test coverage

### Before You Start

2. For major changes, create an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Make sure your contribution aligns with the project's goals

## üîÑ Development Process

### Workflow

1. **Sync your fork** with upstream before starting work:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with clear commit messages

6. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
